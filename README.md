# rock-paper-scissors

This "rock paper scissors" game is text based where the player and the computer choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. Both the player and the computer simultaneously reveal their choices and the winner is the one with the option that defeats the other player's choice. The game will continue as long as the player choose "Yes" to play another round.

## How to run
Rock paper scissors requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.

Install it and then run:

```
python main.py
```
NOTE! On some systems, you might need to use python3 instead of python to specify the version. If you have both Python 2.x and Python 3.x installed, using python3 ensures that your Python 3 interpreter is used.
